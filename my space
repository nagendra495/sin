Pull yourself out of a cycle of negative thoughts

We all dwell on unresolved personal conflicts from time to time. Who hasn’t ruminated on a hurtful comment or unintentional harm we might have caused someone? Feeling bad about something you did, or something done to you, is human. Congratulations on not being a psychopath!

But while it’s expected that the arguments we’ve had, the negative events we’ve experienced, and the major decisions we face haunt us, overthinking can also pile on new problems.

Rumination, or “overthinking,” is a hallmark of poor mental health and unhappiness. It is a psychological tendency that, if left unchecked, can reduce our enjoyment of life, ensuring we are never satisfied for long.

Yes, there are benefits to analyzing the past. But too much rumination can torment you and, worse, cloud your judgment about how to proceed into the future. The consequences of too much rumination are focusing on problems rather than solutions, sacrificing the present moment, and losing productive time, sleep, and healthy relationships.

Studies show there’s a way to circumvent rumination, which has myriad benefits, including helping us to overcome distraction in a world that has evolved faster than we have.
